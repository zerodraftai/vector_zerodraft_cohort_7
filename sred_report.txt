technological_uncertainties: 1. The first technological uncertainty was related to the development and credibility of various aspects of the system. Given that the system being developed was unlike any existing systems, it was uncertain how to design and structure it in a way that would effectively guide users through a complex process by asking critical questions. The conventional means of resolving this issue would be through the application of existing system design principles, however, due to the unique nature of the system, these principles were not applicable.

2. The second technological uncertainty was concerned with the validation of system's responses. It was uncertain how to ensure that the system was providing correct and accurate answers to the critical questions asked. In traditional systems, manual checking and cross-referencing could be used for validation, but given the complexity of the process and the quantity of critical questions involved, this was not feasible.

3. The third technological uncertainty was related to the iterative development process. The team was uncertain about how to effectively track and diagnose key findings in order to refine the system. Conventional means like using pre-existing tracking systems were not suitable due to the innovative nature of the project.

It was unknown what means could be employed to resolve the above issues. The complexity of the project, the novel nature of the system, and the lack of applicable conventional methods presented significant technological uncertainties that the team attempted to overcome.

work_done: 1. In response to the first technological uncertainty, we developed a hypothesis that a user-centric design approach would aid in structuring the system in a way that could effectively guide users through the process. To test this hypothesis, a prototype was developed implementing a user-centric design that asked critical questions throughout the process. The prototype was then subjected to a series of user testing sessions. The results of these tests were mixed. While some users were able to navigate through the process with ease, others found the sequence of questions confusing. We concluded that while a user-centric approach does have its merits, it needs to be refined for optimal user experience. Thus, this issue will be continued to be addressed in the next fiscal year.

2. To overcome the second technological uncertainty, we formulated a hypothesis that the use of an AI-based validation system could ensure the accuracy of the system's responses. A prototype was designed and implemented with an AI-based validation system. The prototype was tested by comparing system responses with expert-reviewed correct answers. The results were promising, with the AI system achieving a high degree of accuracy in its responses. However, the AI system occasionally made errors in its judgement, leading to incorrect validation. The project was partially successful, resolving the issue to a certain extent, but further refinement of the AI-based validation system is needed.

3. The third technological uncertainty was addressed by hypothesizing that a custom-built tracking system could effectively track and diagnose key findings. A prototype of the tracking system was designed, implemented, and tested. The system was able to track key findings and helped in refining the system. However, it was found that the system sometimes overlooked minor but crucial aspects during tracking. Therefore, while the project was partially successful in overcoming this uncertainty, the efforts will continue in the future to perfect the tracking system. 

In conclusion, all three technological uncertainties were partially resolved. While substantial progress was made in overcoming these uncertainties, further work and refinement are required. Therefore, the project will continue into the next fiscal year.

technological_advancements: Technological Advancements Achieved:

1. User-Centric System Design: The project sought to improve user experience by implementing a user-centric system design. The prototype developed revealed that while the user-centric design is effective, it requires further refinement to ensure optimal user experience. This advancement was partially achieved, with future work required to fully resolve the identified technological uncertainty.

2. AI-Based Validation System: The project aimed to increase the accuracy of system responses through an AI-based validation system. The prototype successfully demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in system responses, marking this as a significant technological advancement. However, the occasional errors in judgement by the AI system suggest that further refinement is necessary.

3. Custom-Built Tracking System: The project attempted to effectively track and diagnose key findings through a custom-built tracking system. Although the system succeeded in tracking key findings, minor but crucial aspects were occasionally overlooked. This indicates that the advancement was partially achieved, and further refinement of the system is needed.

In summary, each of these advancements represents a significant step forward in the respective areas of system design, AI validation, and tracking. The lessons learned from these advancements will be harnessed in future projects, contributing to ongoing technological progress and innovation. Further work is planned for the next fiscal year to fully resolve the identified uncertainties and optimize the system's performance.
