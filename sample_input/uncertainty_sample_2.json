    "conventionalMeans": "Typically, such workflows would require custom software development or the use of rigid, pre-defined workflow templates that do not adequately address the unique needs of different construction projects.",
    "evaluation": "{\"score\": 3.83, \"feedback\": \"Technological Uncertainty: Evaluation: Level 4 (Significant Uncertainty) - The challenge described indicates a substantial technological uncertainty, as it relates to designing complex, conditional workflows without traditional coding. The task is non-trivial and requires an innovative approach to maintain flexibility and usability, which is not easily achieved through existing knowledge.\\nStandard practice or Existing Knowledge (Conventional Means): Evaluation: Level 3 (Some Specialization Required) - The conventional means suggest that typically such tasks would require custom software development or rigid templates, which implies that some level of specialized knowledge is required to move beyond these limitations. The development of a no-code tool represents a deviation from these standards, requiring expertise in alternative solutions.\\nHypothesis: Evaluation: Level 4 (Highly Complex Hypothesis) - The hypothesis proposed is highly complex, involving the creation of a no-code tool for customizable project management processes. This suggests a deep understanding of the domain and addresses a multifaceted technological uncertainty by allowing flexibility without coding skills.\\nPrototype: Evaluation: Level 4 (Near-Production Prototype) - The prototype developed is a visual, no-code tool that allows drag-and-drop functionality for workflow design. This level of development suggests that the prototype is close to production quality, with most features tested and functioning well, although it might not be fully finalized.\\nTest Methodology: Evaluation: Level 3 (Structured Test Methodology) - The testing of the tool by replicating real-world workflows indicates a systematic and structured approach. The experiments are designed to evaluate the system's flexibility, usability, and accuracy, suggesting a solid methodology. However, further sophistication in testing might be needed to explore complex or non-linear workflows.\\nTest Results: Evaluation: Level 4 (Detailed Results) - The test results provide comprehensive data, pointing out the tool's effectiveness in reducing the need for coding and highlighting limitations with very complex or non-linear workflows. Such detailed results are instrumental in identifying areas for improvement and future development.\\nOverall, the thread appears to be well-executed with significant technological uncertainties being addressed. The development of a near-production prototype and the structured methodology used for testing are particularly strong aspects. The results indicate that while the tool has already had a positive impact, there are limitations that offer opportunities for further innovation and enhancement. The scores reflect a strong performance in SR&ED, with room for continued research and development to fully realize the project's potential.\"}",
