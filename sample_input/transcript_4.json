So I guess, -name-, I don't know how much you know about what's going on, but basically I need to collect some technical information so I can write a nice little write up describing like the technical process, what you guys have."

And yeah, by doing that, basically can figure out what kind of like money we can get back from the government, I guess. Yeah. So yeah, with like *redacted*, I guess we're looking at like the technical work that you guys have worked on. Right. So there's a specific format that CRA wants to see and I'm just going to describe that quickly. You run into a technical problem, you can't use like an off the shelf solution or something obvious and technical. There's nothing in the public kind of domain of expertise that you can apply to fix that problem. So therefore you had to make a hypothesis, a prototype, a test and a test result."
